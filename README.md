## Evaluating styled components

`yarn start`

`yarn storybook`

`yarn test`

### ToDo
 1. Storybook switch theme + read up on how it works (check)
 2. BMI Calculator
 3. Testing (jest?) components + styled components (check on styled components)
 4. When getting data. Show more state (e.g data being fetched) (check)
 5. Add routing
 6. EsLint ?
 7. Look at characters. Why both a container and component. Because of fetch? Answer is in that (check)
 8. Move sagas to sagas folder (check)
 9. Preloader component for when characters are loading.(check)
 10. Create test for api( fetch -> saga ). Google jest redux saga
 11. Read up on Ducks before testing action/reducers https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux/
 12. Nice UX animaitons for click, hover etc. (check)
 13. Connect theme with storybook theme. Right now storybook theme is hardcoded. Should fetch info from ducs.
 14. Fix uniqe key. What being used now feels like a hack. (check)

 ### Next session

Remove loading props from styled component Preloader. Using react instead to hide/show component.
